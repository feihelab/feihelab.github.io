I am an Associate Professor in the Centre for Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling, Coventry University, UK.
My current research interests lie at the interface of control systems engineering, signal processing and neuroscience/biology. Over the years, I have been developing nonlinear system identification and frequency-domain techniques to study complex nonlinear interactions in human brain network, and use such nonlinear features to improve the diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, tremor, and seizures, from neurophysiological signals like electroencephalogram (EEG). I am also interested in statistical machine learnig, network inference and their applications in neuroscience and systems biology, such as identifying complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular (metabolic, genetic) networks.

I previously held research positions at Imperial College London (Theoretical Systems Biology group), University of Sheffield, and University of Manchester (Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology). I received a PhD and an MSc (distinction) in control engineering from University of Manchester. I am the Associate Editor of _IET Healthcare Technology Letters_, editorial board member of _Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience/Neuroinformatics_, and have served as reviewer for a number of peer-reviewed journals (including 4 _IEEE Transactions, Proc. IEEE, Automatica, Biophys. J., Cereb. Cortex, IET Systems Biology, Int. J. Control, Entropy_). I am also the reviewer for international funding bodies (including EPSRC and Royal Society). Currently, I am a member of the _UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships (FLF) peer review college_, a Senior Member of IEEE, and a technical committee member of _Biomedical Signal Processing, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society_.

If you are interested to apply for a PhD studentship, a postdoc Fellowship (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie, UKRI, Leverhulme, Newton International), or a visiting position in my group, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.

2. [Jan 2023] I have a **fully-funded PhD studentship** (jointly with A\*STAR) for Sep 2023 start, on the topic of [Deep Learning, Brain Network and Dynamical System](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/deep-learning-on-neurophysiological-signals-for-characterising-neurodegenerative-diseases/?p155424) (see link for details). Interested candidates please send me your CV. 

2. [Nov 2022] We have a [Research Fellow position](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CVK069/research-fellow) open (8-month, funded by EPSRC). Please get in touch with us, if you are interested.

3. [Oct 2022] I gave a seminar talk at [NVIDIA](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-gps-ai-capacity-building/nvaitc-research) as part of the NVAITC Technical Talk Series.

4. [September 2022] Glad to co-edit 1) a Research Topic on [Emerging Talents in Neuroinformatics: 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/45891/emerging-talents-in-neuroinformatics-2023#overview) in _Frontiers in Neuroinformatics_ (Welcome for submissions, especially student authors - abstract deadline 08 Jan 2023), and 2) a Research Topic on [Generative AI for Brain Imaging and Brain Network Construction](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/44784/generative-ai-for-brain-imaging-and-brain-network-construction) in _Frontiers in Neuroscience_  (abstract deadline 26 Nov 2022).

5. [September 2022] I visited Prof. Maarten De Vos's group at the [STADIUS Centre for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/), KU Leuven, Belgium. This visit is supported by EU COST Action (AI-4-NICU).

6. [September 2022] Our recent paper [EEG-based Graph Neural Network Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: An Empirical Evaluation of Functional Connectivity Methods](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9878348), has been published in _IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering_.

7. [July 2022] I was awarded an EPSRC grant (as Co-I) jointly with Prof. Eun-Jin Kim (PI) on 'Information geometric theory of neural information processing and disorder'.

8. [July 2022] I attended the _44th IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (EMBC)_ with my students Dominik Klepl and Stephan Goerttler, at Glasgow. Dominik presented his paper [Bispectrum-based Cross-frequency Functional Connectivity: Classification of Alzheimer’s disease](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9871366).

10. [March 2022] Our paper [Characterising Alzheimer's Disease with EEG-based Energy Landscape Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516993) is now published in _IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics_. It is also selected as the [front cover featured article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9729648) of the current issue. The results show AD patients’ brain network/state transitions are more constrained with more local minima, less variation and smaller basins. These features of Energy Landscape can potentially be used to predict AD with high accuracy.
