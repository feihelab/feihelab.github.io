I am an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Centre for Data Science, School of Computing, Electronics, and Mathematics, Coventry University, UK.
My current research interests are at the interface between control systems engineering and neuroscience - especially the use of nonlinear system identification to study complex nonlinear interactions in human brain network and diagnosis of neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, tremor, seizures). I am also interested in statistical machine learnig, network inference and their applications in neuroscience and systems biology, e.g. identifying complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular (metabolic, genetic) networks.

I previously held research positions at Imperial College London (Theoretical Systems Biology group), University of Sheffield, and University of Manchester (Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology). I received a PhD and an MSc (distinction) in control engineering from the University of Manchester.

News!
------
1. I am co-editing a Special issue for *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience & Frontiers in Neuroinformatics* on [Nonlinear Connectivity, Causality and Information Processing in Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/20200/nonlinear-connectivity-causality-and-information-processing-in-neuroscience). Please confirm your participation now & submit your abstract by 15 June, 2021! 

2. A fully-funded [Doctoral Training Alliance (DTA)](https://unialliance.ac.uk/dta/programmes/) PhD studentship is available on developing Novel Information-Theoretic Causality Measure with application in Neuroscience and Dementiato (jointly led by Prof. E Kim and me). Further details can be found [here](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-opportunities/research-students/research-studentships/novel-information-theoretic-causality-measure/). Application deadline: 17 May, 2021.

3. Fully-funded PhD studentships (international, UK/EU) available for September 2021 start, jointly led by me and Dr Min Wu from Singapore A-STAR, on [Network Inference, Brain Connectivity & Machine Learning](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/network-inference-and-machine-learning-understanding-brain-connectivity-and-neurological-disorders/?p129069). Please email me your CV before apply.

4. New preprint! Nice work from *Dominik Klepl* on [Characterising Alzheimer's Disease with EEG-based Energy Landscape Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09882). The results show AD patients’ brain network/state transition are more constrained with more local minima, less variation and smaller basins. Those features of Energy Landscape can potentially be used to predict AD with high accuracy.

5. Our review (with Dr Yuan Yang) on [Nonlinear System Identification of Neural Systems from Neurophysiological Signals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452220307703) is published in *Neuroscience*. You can find the [preprint here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343563477_Nonlinear_System_Identification_of_Neural_Systems_from_Neurophysiological_Signals).
