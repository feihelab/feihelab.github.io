I am an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Centre for Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling, Coventry University, UK.
My current research interests are at the interface between control systems engineering and neuroscience - especially the use of nonlinear system identification to study complex nonlinear interactions in human brain network and diagnosis of neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, tremor, seizures). I am also interested in statistical machine learnig, network inference and their applications in neuroscience and systems biology, e.g. identifying complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular (metabolic, genetic) networks.

I previously held research positions at Imperial College London (Theoretical Systems Biology group), University of Sheffield, and University of Manchester (Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology). I received a PhD and an MSc (distinction) in control engineering from University of Manchester. I am editorial board member of Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, and have served as reviewer for a number of peer-reviewed journals (including 4 IEEE Transactions, Proc. IEEE, Automatica, Biophys. J., Cereb. Cortex, IET Systems Biology, Int. J. Control, Entropy). I am also the reviewer for international funding bodies (including EPSRC, Royal Society). Currently, I am a member of the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships (FLF) peer review college.

If you are interested to apply for a PhD studentship, a postdoc Fellowship (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie, UKRI, Leverhulme, Newton International), or a visiting position in my group, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.

News!

1. [March 2022] I gave an invited talk on “System Identification and Frequency-Domain Analysis in Neuroscience” at MRC Biomedical Engineering Workshop: Application of Engineering to Healthcare, at the University of Warwick, 3 March 2022.

2. [March 2022] Our paper [Characterising Alzheimer's Disease with EEG-based Energy Landscape Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516993) is now published in _IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics_. It is also selected as the [front cover featured article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9729648) of the current issue. The results show AD patients’ brain network/state transitions are more constrained with more local minima, less variation and smaller basins. These features of Energy Landscape can potentially be used to predict AD with high accuracy.
