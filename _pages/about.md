I am an Assistant Professor in Centre for Data Science, School of Computing, Electronics, and Mathematics, Coventry University.
My current research interests are at the interface between control systems engineering and neuroscience - esepcially the use of nonlinear system identification to study complex nonlinear interactions in human brain network and diagnosis of neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, tremor, seizures). I am also interested in network inference of complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular (metabolic, genetic) networks.

**Research interests**

- NARMAX model-based nonlinear frequency analysis 
- Nonlinear connectivity, cross-frequncy coupling & causality analysis
- Network inference for complex biochemical and neurological networks
- Bayesian inference (parameter estimation and model selection), model-based experimental design

News!
------
1. 2 fully-funded PhD studentships (international, UK/EU) for September 2021 start, jointly led by me and Dr Min Wu from Singapore A-STAR, on [Network Inference, Brain Connectivity & Machine Learning](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/network-inference-and-machine-learning-understanding-brain-connectivity-and-neurological-disorders/?p129069). Please email me your CV before apply.

2. New preprint! Nice work from *Dominik Klepl* on [Characterising Alzheimer's Disease with EEG-based Energy Landscape Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09882). The results show AD patients’ brain network/state transition are more constrained with more local minima, less variation and smaller basins. Those features of Energy Landscape can potentially be used to predict AD with high accuracy.

3. Our review (with Dr Yuan Yang) on [Nonlinear System Identification of Neural Systems from Neurophysiological Signals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452220307703) is published in *Neuroscience*. You can find the [preprint here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343563477_Nonlinear_System_Identification_of_Neural_Systems_from_Neurophysiological_Signals).
