I am an Associate Professor in the Centre for Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling, Coventry University, UK.
My current research interests lie at the interface of control systems engineering, signal processing and neuroscience/biology. Over the years, I have been developing nonlinear system identification and frequency-domain techniques to study complex nonlinear interactions in human brain network, and use such nonlinear features to improve the diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and seizures, from neurophysiological signals like electroencephalogram (EEG). I am also interested in statistical machine learnig, network inference and their applications in neuroscience and systems biology, such as identifying complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular (metabolic, genetic) networks.

Currently, I co-lead the 'Digital Health' Cross Cutting Theme at Coventry University. I am a member of the _UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships (FLF) peer review college_ and a Senior Member of IEEE. I am an Associate Editor of _IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering (TNSRE)_, _Frontiers in Neurology_ and _IET Healthcare Technology Letters_, an Editorial Board Member of _Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience/Neuroinformatics_, and a reviewer for international funding bodies, including EPSRC and Royal Society. I previously held research positions at Imperial College London (Theoretical Systems Biology group), University of Sheffield, and University of Manchester (Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology). I received a PhD and an MSc (distinction) in control engineering from University of Manchester. 

If you are interested to apply for a PhD studentship, a postdoc Fellowship (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie, UKRI, Leverhulme, Newton International), or a visiting position in my group, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
